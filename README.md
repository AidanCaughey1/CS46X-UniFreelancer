## Development Workflow
We follow a structured Git workflow to ensure code quality and collaboration efficiency:
- All new work is done in a feature branch.
- Changes are submitted via Pull Request (PR).
- Each PR requires at least one code review before merging.
- After approval, the PR can be merged into the main branch.
