**Core Tools:** GitHub (issues, CI/CD), Discord (communication), Google Docs (notes), Figma (design), VS Code.    
**Risks:** Integration complexity, database schema mismatch, and unclear payment platform (Stripe vs Sharetribe).    
**Escalation Path:**  
1. Peer discussion within 24 hrs.  
2. Escalate to TA/instructor if unresolved or blocking sprint progress.

## Conflict Resolution & Accountability
**Triggers:** Missed deadlines, unreviewed PRs > 48 h, repeated meeting absences.
**Step by Step Plan:**
1. Send a reminder and quick checkup - Make sure the team member(s) is aware of the problem and if they need any help to handle it. (Within 24h of conflict not resolving)
2. Meeting - Sit down with the team member(s) and discuss evidence and create an action plan to resolve the conflict. (Within 48h of conflict not resolving)
3. Follow Up - Following up with team members and making sure that the action plan is being followed. (Within 1w of the conflict)
4. Escalate - contact instructor and determine how to solve this issue (ASAP if follow up fails)

## Definition of Done (DoD) & Quality Gates
**DOD:** A task or feature is considered done when all of the following conditions are met:
1. The feature meets all acceptance criteria in the issue description and passes functional testing.
2. Code compiles without errors or warnings and passes all automated tests in CI.
3. Code has been reviewed and approved by at least one team member through a GitHub pull request.
4. Documentation (README, in-code comments, or API docs) has been updated to reflect changes.
5. No sensitive data is hardcoded or pushed to the repo.
6. The new functionality is deployed successfully to the test branch without breaking existing features.

**Quality Gates:** To ensure our main branch always remains shippable, each request must pass these quality checks before merging:
1. Run unit and integration tests through GitHub Actions
2. No new dependencies added without a review for licensing and security impact.
3. Changes that affect setup, APIs, or UI must include updates to relevant documentation
4. Reviewers verify readability, maintainability, and adherence to project structure

## Accessibility & Inclusion Practices
**Meeting Norms**  
- Weekly project partner meetings occur via Zoom, led by the Project Manager.  
- A reminder is sent in Discord ten minutes before each meeting, with the Zoom link posted five minutes prior.  
- Team members unable to attend notify the group in advance; meetings are recorded and shared in Discord for review.  
- Zoom auto-captions are enabled by default to support accessibility.  
- Each meeting includes a brief check-in and follows inclusive **turn-taking** so that every member can contribute comfortably.  

**Inclusive Participation**  
- Most discussions and decision-making occur asynchronously in Discord, ensuring equal participation across different schedules and time zones.  
- Team members are encouraged to share ideas, feedback, or concerns freely, whether during live discussions or asynchronously.  
- Constructive feedback is the norm; team members build on each other’s ideas rather than compete for airtime.  
- Note-taking rotates weekly to include diverse perspectives and distribute responsibility.  

**Requesting Accommodations**  
- Team members may request adjustments such as flexible deadlines, reduced meeting frequency, or modified task assignments by notifying the Team and Project Manager in advance (via Discord).  
- The team reviews accommodation requests collaboratively to ensure fairness and transparency while maintaining project progress.  

**Addressing Barriers**  
- Any accessibility or participation barriers (e.g., technical issues, scheduling conflicts, unclear communication) can be raised in Discord or during meetings without penalty.  
- The Project Manager tracks recurring issues and discusses potential solutions with the team or escalates them to the TA if unresolved.  
- Barriers and inclusion improvements are reviewed during sprint retrospectives, and adjustments are made as needed.
