**Core Tools:** GitHub (issues, CI/CD), Discord (communication), Google Docs (notes), Figma (design), VS Code.    
**Risks:** Integration complexity, database schema mismatch, and unclear payment platform (Stripe vs Sharetribe).    
**Escalation Path:**  
1. Peer discussion within 24 hrs.  
2. Escalate to TA/instructor if unresolved or blocking sprint progress.

## Conflict Resolution & Accountability
**Triggers:** Missed deadlines, unreviewed PRs > 48 h, repeated meeting absences.
**Step by Step Plan:**
1. Send a reminder and quick checkup - Make sure the team member(s) is aware of the problem and if they need any help to handle it. (Within 24h of conflict not resolving)
2. Meeting - Sit down with the team member(s) and discuss evidence and create an action plan to resolve the conflict. (Within 48h of conflict not resolving)
3. Follow Up - Following up with team members and making sure that the action plan is being followed. (Within 1w of the conflict)
4. Escalate - contact instructor and determine how to solve this issue (ASAP if follow up fails)
