# Team Charter & Working Agreement
**Team 37 – UniFreelancer Academy**  
**Partner:** Alina Padilla-Miller – UniFreelancer  
**Date:** 2025-11-02  
**Repo:** [github.com/AidanCaughey1/CS46X-UniFreelancer](https://github.com/AidanCaughey1/CS46X-UniFreelancer)

**Roles:**  
- Aidan Caughey – Project Manager / Backend Developer
- Aiden McCoy – Partner Liaison / Backend Developer
- Baron Baker – Data Lead / Backend Developer
- Daniel Molina – Technical Architect / Frontend Developer
- Nafizur Rahman – Frontend Developer

**Decision Rule:** Consensus with majority vote (3/5) fallback.  
**Meeting Cadence:** Communicating daily (Discord), weekly partner check-ins, biweekly TA meetings, and sprint retros via Google Docs.  
**Core Tools:** GitHub (issues, CI/CD), Discord (communication), Google Docs (notes), Figma (design), VS Code.    
**Risks:** Integration complexity, database schema mismatch, and unclear payment platform (Stripe vs Sharetribe).    
**Escalation Path:**  
1. Peer discussion within 24 hrs.  
2. Escalate to TA/instructor if unresolved or blocking sprint progress.
